<<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
</p>

<p>HTML is cool</p>
<p>CSS is cooler</p>
<p>JS is the best</p>

<h3>What do you need to create a website?</h3>

<p>Not much!</p>
<ul>A text editor (I am using atom)</ul>
<ul>A web browser (I am using chrome)</ul>
<ul>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</ul>

<h4>Follow my progress on github!</h4>
